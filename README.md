## AWS Bookstore Demo App

AWS Bookstore Demo App is a full-stack sample web application that creates a storefront (and backend) for customers to shop for fictitious books. The entire application can be created with a single CloudFormation template. https://d2h3ljlsmzojxz.cloudfront.net/


## Overview

The goal of AWS Bookstore Demo App is to provide a fully-functional web application that utilizes multiple purpose-built AWS databases and native AWS components like Amazon API Gateway and AWS CodePipeline. Increasingly, modern web apps are built using a multitude of different databases. Developers break their large applications into individual components and select the best database for each job. Let's consider AWS Bookstore Demo App as an example. The app contains multiple experiences such a shopping cart, product search, recommendations, and a top sellers list. For each of these use cases, the app makes use of a purpose-built database so the developer never has to compromise on functionality, performance, or scale. 


**Infrastructure components**

* Continuous deployment code pipeline – AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild help you build, test, and release your application code. 
* Serverless web application – Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3 provide a globally-distributed application.
